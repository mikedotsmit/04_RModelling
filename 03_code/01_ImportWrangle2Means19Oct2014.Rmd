This file is the starting point. 
This Code imports raw data for a specific test conducted.
In this case:

+ the test includes two industrial screens
+ each screen has five decks with the same apperture that receive the 'same' feed.

This file determines the averages of the five decks for use in modeling.
The filename (of this file) denotes the specific test which's code is represented here.

The outputs from this file is used within or drawn into the various chapters of the analasys and subsequently into the final file (base.Rmd) for conversion to PDF (currently not HTML (my code)).
outputs are exported or written to code/01_code-outputs.

# each screen has 5 decks and here ill average these. "deck_0" is a sample taken from the distributor that feeds the screen and thus represents all 5 decks. in this excercise ill combine the distributor sample with th decks to compile a mean.

# In this excercise ill focus on the means of the distributions.
#separating x and y eases calculation steps

# there no confusion when i use the term "takeout" (like pizza) i.e. take from here to smw else.
# simmilarlt, Im trying "BrinIn" on the other end (the child of the mother file where this code will be brought in .)
##I should have a lis tin thie beginning  of this script detailing a list of these depencansies, so one can see at 1st glance the risk of changing code.

#pull this mean column out as a vector to use later:

plotting raw_psd feed distribution to have a quick view if they are simmilar. if they are not (simmilar) then the expeririment or test will not not give conclusive results. as our aim is to test if one panel size is "signifficantly" better than another panels size.

```{r }
FeedRawPSD <- cbind(sieve, Feed13MeanPct, Feed14MeanPct) 
OSRawPSD <- cbind(sieve, OS13MeanPct, OS14MeanPct)  
USRawPSD <- cbind(sieve, US13MeanPct, US14MeanPct)
```
```{r}
RawPSD <- cbind(
  sieve,
  Feed13MeanPct,
  Feed14MeanPct,
  OS13MeanPct,
  OS14MeanPct,
  US13MeanPct,
  US14MeanPct
  ) 

```

```{r }
write.csv(FeedRawPSD, here("03_code/01_code-output","FeedRawPSD.csv"),row.names = FALSE)
write.csv(OSRawPSD, here("03_code/01_code-output","OSRawPSD.csv"),row.names = FALSE)
write.csv(USRawPSD, here("03_code/01_code-output","USRawPSD.csv"),row.names = FALSE)

write.csv(RawPSD, here("03_code/01_code-output","RawPSD.csv"),row.names = FALSE)
```

To Do : analasys of the means of the two screens?
