# packages
# this is the central place where this project will attach packages from.
# allpackeges are accumulated here (manualy).
# 
# the reason for doing this is to avoid duplicating all packages across all files.
# this eases knitting from both the 'mother-' or base.Rmd and knitting from individual files as well.
# add new packes in the list below names "mypackages" then
# run the chunck code. the chunk will write a csv file that the other files contained within the prject folder will read and attach.
